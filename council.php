            Abhiyan, 2013 have recommended that the State level planning and co-ordination of Higher education including
            University Education shall be done through an independent, autonomous Council for Higher Education.
            Accordingly, in order to bring out better excellence, inclusiveness and accessibility in the Higher
            Education Sector, the State Government has decided to constitute the State Level Higher Education Council to
            be known as Goa State Higher Education Council. The Council shall function in order to forge synergic
            relationship amongst the State Government, Universities, academics and experts by occupying an operational
            space between the Government and Universities on one hand and between Universities and apex level regulatory
            institutions on the other. The main objects of the Council includes planned and co-ordinated development of
            Higher education in the State, promoting academic excellence and social justice by obtaining academic input
            for policy formulation and perspective planning, ensuring autonomy, accountability and co-ordination of all
            institutions of higher education in the State and guiding the growth of higher education in accordance with
            the socio-economic requirements of the State.
