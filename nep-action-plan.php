                <br>
                Karnataka’s SSP is an entitlement-based scheme, where students do not apply for the scholarship; they are automatically selected based on their eligibility, and the scholarships are disbursed through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) process. The data for this selection is obtained from the existing academic management system, and various other departments including the State Welfare and Tax Departments where essential data of the students can be obtained.
