              <div class="col-md-7">
                The core of new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 is to develop a Learner-centric education system that will provide quality and truly holistic education for all-round  growth of Learners. Looking at the successful institutions that make at the top of the World Rankings, two common features emerge: 
                <strong>(1) they are all research institutions, and (2) they are large in terms of student population, often with more than 10,000 students on a single campus, and providing UG, PG, and PhD programs on a single campus.</strong>
                These characteristics of top institutions make their campus vibrant, and provide students even at UG level, an unique opportunity to interact with PhD students, Postdoctoral fellows, researchers, and faculty. Furthermore, the use of common infrastructure, and access to the state-of-the art facilities becomes feasible.

              </div>
              <div class="col-md-7 pt-30">
                The above successful model of education is not too different from India’s ancient campuses like Nalanda University which was catering to about 10,000 students and providing truly multidisciplinary education in Buddhist studies, fine arts, medicine,  mathematics, politics, astronomy, and art of war.
              </div>

              </div>
              <div class="col-md-7 pt-30">
                Thus, the implementation of NEP 2020 in true spirit needs to be done focusing on such successful models. Above all, focusing on Research in all HEIs including at UG level is a must because it is only through Research, we can produce enthusiastic teachers, and experiential teaching-Learning process for students. Research is the backbone of any developed nation, and only research can enhance the standards of living of our society. Finally, and most importantly, preparing students both mentally and physically, for life-long learning will be a major milestone to be achieved through NEP 2020.

                Goa has a very good equity as well as gender parity in Higher Education. As can be seen from Table 1, for the last three years, the enrollment of Female students is significantly higher than the male students.

                Enrollment of female students in Goa has seen  quite an increase of up to 11% in the year 2019-2020,  compared with the male students. This is likely attributed to the encouragement of female students for higher education as well as because of the conducive  academic environment for female students. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Similarly, the GER of Goa is significantly higher compared to the overall GER of India, especially for SC and ST students. This can be attributed to the access to higher educational institutions (HEIs): all government colleges in Goa are strategically built in rural areas providing easy access to quality higher education.
                <br>
                <br>
                Goa University, the only state university, has a full fledged hostel on campus. Construction and planning  of hostel accommodation in a few other HEIs  are in progress.

                    While Goa’s GER is higher compared with the national GER, a detailed study is needed to identify the reasons why students are unable to pursue higher education.

                  <li>
                    Further, to improve GER, appropriate Degree/Skill-based program should be introduced. This again requires a detailed study.

                Goa has been very proactive in promoting online education. Following the MOOCs standards, the Directorate of Higher Education, Goa had put a framework in place to develop e-content focused on the actual syllabus of Undergraduate Degree Programs. For this purpose, an online platform named DISHTAVO (Digital Integrated System for Holistic Teaching And Virtual Orientation) was developed. 
                <br>
                <br>
                DISHTAVO is an online e-content web portal, entirely developed in-house,  for  providing free access to UG academic content in Arts, Commerce, Science, Music, Law, Home Science,  Agriculture, & Education, and currently accessible at 
                <br>

                  <li>
                    Six temporary studios have been setup for training, recording of the video lectures.

                  <li>
                    More than 1500 teaching faculty are involved in producing about 16,000 lecture videos.

                  </li>
                </ul>
                MoU signing with SWAYAM for the production of MOOCs is in progress. For this purpose, development of  MOOCs is already in progress. Unlike traditional MOOC production by individual faculties, an unique thing that we have adopted is that we have provided centralized facilities and a dedicated team for coordination of such MOOC courses. In the first phase 5 MOOCs are being developed. A few film directors have also been hired to give MOOC production direction to improve the presentation quality of MOOC content.
                <br>
                <br>
                For ODL, and credit transfer, we  have collaborated with IIT Mumbai. In the first phase, computer courses are being offered for BSc Computer Science degree program in Credit Transfer mode in all government colleges, where blended teaching mode is being currently adopted.
