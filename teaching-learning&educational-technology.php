            <h4>TCS conducts Faculty Development program (FDP) in Banking for Business Process for Commerce faculty from all HEIs</h4>
            <div>
              “Technology has completely changed the economic and business landscape in the entire world. Therefore, higher education faculty must be equipped with skills and knowledge to prepare students for this technology-driven future. This will enhance the quality of higher education”, said Prasad Lolayekar, Director of Higher Education.  He was speaking at the inaugural function of the 5-day Faculty Development Program (FDP) organized by the Directorate of Higher Education (DHE) and Goa State Higher Education Council (GSHEC), Government of Goa in collaboration with Tata Consultancy Services. The FDP for commerce faculty as Train the Trainer program was one of the objectives of the MoU to be signed between GSHEC, DHE and TCS in March 2023.
            </div>
            <div>
              This FDP is a part of a much bigger initiative under ”Motivated, Energized, and Capable Faculty”, one of the main themes of new National Education Policy (NEP 2020). Under this initiative, faculty in higher education are being continuously trained and upskilled.
            </div>
            <div>
              Retail Banking expert Jesal Kapadia, Manager BFSI Anupama Patil, and Domain Consultant Chandrakala B from TCS were the resource person for this FDP that was held  from 30th January to 3rd February, 2023 at Porvorim.
            </div>
            <div>
              The training was aimed at upskilling faculty from Commerce and economics disciplines, and focussed on Retail and Corporate Banking, electronic payment systems via Debit and Credit cards, Mortgages, Cash Managements and Trade Finances. A total of 46 faculty from 19 Colleges were trained during the FDP.
            </div>
            <div>
              This FDP will certainly help faculty to introduce new skill-based courses in higher education,  and build the Academic-Industry connect, one of the main goals under NEP 2020, said Prof. Niyan Marchon at the Valedictory function. Dr. Anson Albuquerque, Saurabh Naik and Ms. Vandana Sawant of Goa State Higher Education Council coordinated the event.
