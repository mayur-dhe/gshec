This would help build vibrant communities of scholars and peers, break down harmful silos, enable students to become well-rounded across disciplines (including artistic, creative, and analytic subjects as well as sports), develop active research communities across disciplines (including cross-disciplinary research), and increase resource efficiency, both material and human, across higher education. ",
                "Moving to large multidisciplinary universities and HEI clusters is thus the highest recommendation of this policy regarding the structure of higher education. The ancient Indian universities Takshashila and Nalanda, which had thousands of students from India and the world studying in vibrant multidisciplinary environments, and modern universities such as the Ivy League Universities/Stanford/MIT in the United States today, amply demonstrate the type of great success that such large multidisciplinary research universities can bring. It is time that India brings back this great Indian tradition which is needed more today than ever to create well-rounded and innovative individuals, and which is already transforming other countries educationally and economically.",
