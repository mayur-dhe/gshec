        "The Ministry of Human Resource Development, University Grants Commission, 
        and Rashtriya Uchhatar Shiksha Abhiyan, 2013 has recommended that the State 
        level of planning and coordination of Higher education including University 
        Education shall be done through an independent, autonomous Council for Higher Education. 
        Accordingly, in order to bring out better excellence, inclusiveness, and accessibility in 
        the Higher Education Sector, the State Government has decided to constitute the State Level 
        Higher Education Council to be known as Goa State Higher Education Council. The Council shall 
        function in order to forge synergic relationships amongst the State Government, Universities, 
        academics, and experts by occupying an operational space between the Government and Universities 
        on one hand and between Universities and apex-level regulatory institutions on the other. The main 
        objects of the Council include planned and coordinated development of Higher education in the State, 
        promoting academic excellence and social justice by obtaining academic input for policy formulation and 
        perspective planning, ensuring autonomy, accountability, and coordination of all institutions of higher 
        education in the State and guiding the growth of higher education in accordance with the socio-economic 
        requirements of the State."
